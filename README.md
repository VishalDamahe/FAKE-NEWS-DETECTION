**📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning**

**📌 Overview**


This project detects fake news articles using Machine Learning.
It preprocesses text data, applies feature extraction, trains classification models, and evaluates their accuracy.
The goal is to build an automated tool to identify unreliable news sources.

**🚀 Features**

Preprocessing: Text cleaning, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF).

Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Performance Evaluation: Train/Test split and accuracy metrics.

Extensible: Can be integrated into APIs or web apps (Flask/Streamlit) for real-time use.

**📊 Dataset**

The dataset contains labeled news articles:

title: Headline of the article

text: Content of the article

label: 1 → Fake, 0 → Real
